                <p>
                    This is Vigneswari Sambandam aka Viggy. I live in Cincinnati, Ohio, and am doing my masters in Information Technology.
                    I'm an accomplished IT professional with 14 years of experience developing and architecting IT applications across
                    industries with a proven track record of delivering value to Healthcare, Telecom, and Service Industries businesses. I
                    wanted to upskill myself and embrace the changes and happenings in recent years in IT. So, I took a break and came to
                    the US for a master's, and I'm also doing the Berkeley Coding Bootcamp for additional skills. Apart from work and
                    studies, I love watching movies, listening to music, and sometimes reading books. I empathize with people and hate all
                    kinds of discrimination against people in all forms.

                <p>
                    The task manager application helps us to manage everyday tasks or activities. The single-page application was developed
                    using HTML, CSS, JS technology, and third-party APIs like jQuery, Bulma CSS, and Dayjs. To manage the activities, one
                    must log in to the application. The application offers Google authentication using Firebase and gathers user data for
                    tracking activities for the user. It uses the Firebase firestore database to store and maintain the data in the cloud,
                    which enables one to use the application on any browser. Herewith, the application uses two external APIs of the
                    Firebase for authentication and storage service. However, the application also uses the browser's local storage feature
                    to store the data locally.
